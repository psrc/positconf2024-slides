Can we use data to answer questions, resolve debates, and make better decisions? What tools and processes make data science work? What can we learn when it does, and what goes wrong when it doesn’t?\n\n\nWe need to say 3 things at the same time:\n1. On long term trends, almost everything is getting better \n\n2. We still have serious problems to solve \n\n3. And history suggests we can address them\n\n\n\nPhoto credit: Posit Co"
